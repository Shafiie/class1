<p>Kota Bharu (Jawi: كوت بهارو; Chinese: 哥打峇鲁; occasionally referred to as Kota Baharu) is a city in Malaysia that serves as the state capital and royal seat of Kelantan. It is also the name of the territory (jajahan) or district in which Kota Bharu City is situated. The name means 'new city' or 'new castle/fort' in Malay. Kota Bharu is situated in the northeastern part of Peninsular <em>Malaysia,</em> and lies near the mouth of the Kelantan River at 6°8′N 102°15′E. The northeastern Malaysian city is close to the <strong>Thailand</strong> border. Kota Bharu is home to many mosques, various museums, the unique architecture of the old royal palaces (still occupied by the sultan and sultanah and off-limits to visitors but viewable from outside) and former royal buildings (which can be visited) in the centre of town.</p>

<p>The Kelantanese culture is highly influenced by Thai culture because of its geographical proximity to <strong>Thailand.</strong>The Chinese are much more assimilated to local culture than those in other parts of <em>Malaysia.</em> Much of the food is sweet, with rice as the primary staple. Traditional dances like Mak Yong and Wayang Kulit were once widely practised, but are actively suppressed by local authorities because of perceived Hindu influences thought to contradict Islam.</p>
